            This is my website. I am a comedian. I am interested in change. I am interested in awakening – I feel we can do this together because I have changed so much in my own little life. I am still a comedian and I now do LIVE shows weekdays over on Rumble (join it’s free). Join my mailing list to keep updated with everything coming up. Interested in more? Subscribe to ‘Awakened Wonders’ the community over on LOCALS is where I share all the extras from me, behind-the-scenes, LIVE Q&A’s and generally more.</p>
